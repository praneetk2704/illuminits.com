<h1>HISTORY</h1><br></center>

<div class = "container">
As the ILLUMINITS stands for ‘Illuminating Intelligentsia of NIT Silchar’, so does have been

its work and performance. Being one of the most active societies of NIT Silchar; the

ILLUMINITS took a rebirth as Literary, Publication, and Fine Arts Society from being a Literary

&amp; Publication Club, in the year of 2013. With sincere efforts from the Literary &amp; Publication

Secretary of Gymkhana Union Body’2013-14 NIT Silchar, ‘Anurag Anand’ and Cultural

Secretary of the same gymkhana body, ‘Abhradeep Goswami’; the prevailing Literary &amp;

and Publication Club of NIT Silchar became the Literary, Publication, and Fine Arts Society. It

was a pioneering transformation for the society just like for a butterfly that spread its wings after

coming out of her cocoon to take the first flight of her life. <br /><br />
Indeed, after this, the ILLUMINITS never looked back and continued to achieve heights of

success. After the tenure of ‘Anurag Anand’ the baton of ILLUMINITS was passed on to

‘Bhaskar Jha’. He became the second Literary, Publication, and Fine Arts Secretary after

‘Anurag Anand’. The tenure of ‘Bhaskar Jha’ saw the society scheduled filled with

enthralling and fascinating events through-out his tenure of 2014-2015. <br /><br />
The baton of the society was then passed on to ‘Mrinal Shrivastav’, under whom the current

structure of ILLUMINITS was defined with eleven (11) clubs and its constitution. His tenure

continued from 2015-16.<br /><br />
As of current, the society in the firm and strong hands of ‘Dev Manas’, who is the current

Literary, Publication, and Fine Arts Secretary of Gymkhana Union Body’16-17, NIT Silchar. Till

now, under the able leadership of ‘Dev Manas’ the society has witnessed tremendous

success. As a matter of fact, from this year onwards the ILLUMINITS has started participating in

various state level competitions, representing NIT Silchar, and has been successful in all of its

endeavours.<br /><br />
The position of literary secretaries has been helmed by the following people .<br><br>

<br>
<br>
It fills me with great pleasure to know that Illuminits: Literary and Fine Arts Society, NIT Silchar is going to launch its own website. The caravan that I had been a part of has indeed come a long way from the times of 2011, when I had joined the institute. To my experience, it would not be an overstatement to say that it has always been more challenging to provide traction to the literary aspect, as compared to the other elements that constitute the cultural scene of the institute. The foundations that were poured by our esteemed seniors like Pulakesh Upadhayaya, Amit Sarma and Prasenjeet Saha, today supports a thriving literary structure that fills all of us with pride. <br>
Literary activities do not come to be as a productive utilization of one’s leisure, the skills in expression that they help develop greatly contribute to the career and professional well-being of an individual. Hence, it is necessary to create an environment where even the students who do not have a natural inclination towards activities related to literature and art, are made aware of its lasting importance. In this regards, I heartily congratulate the present Literary Secretary, DevManas, who has not only been the worthy successor that we all had envisaged, but has also further built greatly upon the stage set for him by Mrinal Shrivastav. He has untiringly spearheaded all the efforts made on the ground level as well as on the social media, and the launch of this website is indeed a proud testimony to his efforts and vision. I wish him all the best and hope that the students, through their active involvement, shall reap maximum dividends out of such efforts.<br>
With warmest regards, <br>
Anurag Anand, <br>
Literary, Publications and Fine Arts Secretary, <br>
Gymkhana Union Body, 2013-2014<br>

"We all think, imagine and dream; but those are remembered who turn it into reality"
It's a proud and cheerful moment for all of us to get this work done and have dedicated website
for Literary Society. I must say, it is one of the most active group of NIT Silchar where we all are
connected after college times too!<br>
Literature and art has no boundary, no limitations and it doesn't differentiate any one of us.
Each one of us has some talent inside: Someone use to pen down their feelings in the form of
poem, prose etc., someone convert their imaginations onto the paper as art any many more.
But apart from that, many of us has that great talent to take all those imaginations inside us
by reading or view. And I feel that is an art too, to get that exact feeling and sense by which
it was written or made. An artist is well contented when the same happens and all the further
creations depend on appreciations, suggestions and motivation drawn by artists by seeing his
followers.<br>
I thank Dev Manas and his team whole heartedly for this great achievement. During my
tenure, it was my dream to get this work done but due to some reasons it couldn't be done. I
believe, this platform will be utilized in all possible ways to get the motto of work
accomplished.<br>
"Thoughts or Ideas come, many a times they are turned into reality but the success is that
probabilistic thing which depends". Now the success of this work depends on all of us, how
we take it and how we see it.<br>
I again congratulate the team and end here by strong belief that we all will be connected, see
new faces and more counts in our family through this platform.<br>
